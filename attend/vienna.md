## About Vienna / Sightseeing

Vienna (in German: Wien) is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe.
It was the capital of the Austrian-Hungarian empire for many centuries, ruling much of Central Europe and leaving as a legacy magnificent buildings befitting the capital of a large empire, such as the [Hofburg](https://www.hofburg-wien.at/en/) and the [Schönbrunn](https://www.schoenbrunn.at/en/) and [Belvedere](https://www.belvedere.at/en) palaces.

Today, Vienna is the capital as well as cultural and economic center of the Republic of Austria and hosts major international organizations such as the United Nations, OPEC, and OSCE.

Vienna is still regarded as the musical capital of Europe or even the whole world by many music lovers.
It offers exciting concerts, operas and musicals, as well as impressive exhibitions. Enjoy the delights of Viennese cuisine, typical Viennese “Gemütlichkeit” at cafés and Heurigen, or the green side of Vienna in the citys many parks.
See [Vienna’s official tourist information website](https://www.wien.info/en) for more information about Vienna and ticket bookings for concerts and opera performances.


The conference venue is located in the centre of Vienna, in the embassy quarter.
It is right next to sights such as the
[Belvedere palace](https://www.belvedere.at/en), a baroque, 18th-century palaces housing an art museum with a notable Klimt collection,
and the [Botanical Garden of the University of Vienna](https://botanischergarten.univie.ac.at/en/).

The botanical garden is open from **10:00-17:00**. At the far southern end of the botanical garden there
is another entrance where you can access
the garden of Schloss Belvedere from the botanical garden (Eingang Alpengarten). Please, note that the other gates
open 15 minutes later and close 15 minutes earlier than the main entrance to the botanical garden.
**Entry is free** to both the botanical garden and the garden of Schloss Belvedere. The exhibitions in the Schloss Belvedere
require the purchase of a ticket.
The garden of Schloss Belvedere is open from **06:30-19:00**.


## Public Transport in Vienna

There are five underground lines (tickets must be purchased in the stations before proceeding to the platforms) and more than 100 tram and bus lines operated by [Wiener Linien](https://www.wienerlinien.at/), the municipal transport corporation.
Here is a [map of fast connections](https://homepage.univie.ac.at/horst.prillinger/ubahn/m/largemap-s-wien.html).

The conference venue is within walking distance of the city center.

There are tram and bus stops, as well as a local rail (Schnellbahn, or S-Bahn) station close to the conference venue.

## From and To the Airport

The Vienna International Airport (VIE) (Flughafen Wien in German) in Schwechat is about 20 km from the conference venue in the centre of Vienna.
There is a direct connection from the airport to the conference every 30 minutes.
Take the Schnellbahn S7, directions "Wien Floridsdorf Bahnhof" or "Laa/Thaya Bahnhof", and exit at stop "Rennweg".
The conference venue is 200m from "Rennweg".

Checking the schedule and buying the ticket is simple. Just follow the signs at the airport to the trains and go to one of the red ticketing machines (NOT the green machines). Enter the first 3 letters of the destination, "Ren", then choose "Rennweg" as destination from the offered choices.
Select your connection and buy your ticket (cash and cards accepted).

<!--
	Alternatively, you can book a transfer service by AirportDriver with a negotiated conference rate of Euro 40, by entering the code “TU-Wien Konferenz Vösendorf”. Alternatively, taxi service is also available (rates vary).
-->

## Using a car

We advise against using personal cars in Vienna’s city and around historic venues, as traffic can be heavy with long delays and scarce parking. Vienna’s excellent public transport system will allow you to reach most destinations in the city more quickly.
The conference venue itself is in the centre of the city, and well connected by public transport.
You will need a car only if you arrive by personal vehicle, or you plan to explore the mountains surrounding the city.
