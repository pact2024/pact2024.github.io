## About the SRC

PACT 2023 invites students to participate in the ACM Student Research
Competition (SRC).
The SRC is a forum for graduate and undergraduate students to share
their research results, exchange ideas, and improve their communication
skills while competing for prizes.
The SRC consists of three rounds:

1.  **Online abstract submission** authored by the student alone
2.  **Poster session at PACT 2023** by authors for abstracts accepted by
	the selection committee
3.  **Presentation at PACT 2023** by authors of the top poster presenters
	selected by judges at the conference

All rounds will consider the significance of the research contributions
and research methods.
The poster sessions and finalist presentations will also consider the
quality of both visual and oral presentation.

All authors of accepted abstracts will receive a
**discounted conference registration** to help offset costs of
attendance.
**Students must attend PACT 2023 in person** to take part in the poster
session and finalist presentation.
Further student grants may be announced by the conference, and we
encourage all authors of accepted abstracts to apply for those in
addition to the registration discount.
Students will be expected to print and bring their own posters to the
conference.

You can find more information about the SRC on the
[ACM SRC website](https://src.acm.org/).


## Prizes

The top 3 undergraduate and graduate winners will be recognized in the
following ways:

- They will receive monetary prizes of $500, $300, and $200,
  respectively.
- They will receive a framed grand finalist certificate.
- Their names will be posted on the PACT 2023 website.

The first-place winner in each category (undergraduate, graduate) will
also receive an invitation to participate in the SRC Grand Finals, an
online round of competitions among the first-place winners of individual
conference-hosted SRCs.


## Submission

### Extended Abstract Guidelines

- Extended abstracts for the PACT 2023 ACM Student Research Competition
  must be submitted electronically at the [SRC submission site](https://pact23src.hotcrp.com/)
  no later than August 21, 2023 (AoE).
- **Submissions should not exceed ~~1 page~~ 2 pages, and should not exceed 800 words.**
  Figures and references are allowed, but must fit within the two
  pages. References do not count toward the 800-word limit.
- The submission should be in PDF format.
- Blind submissions are fine, but are not required.
- The submission must meet all eligibility requirements below.
- While not required, we recommend that you use the
  [ACM templates](https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/taps-production-workflow).
- The abstract must include
	- Poster title
	- Author name(s) and student status (undergrad/graduate)
	- Affiliation(s),
	- The name of the research advisor(s).
- The abstract should describe the research problem, motivation and
  background, techniques (and their novelty), and results.
- All students whose abstracts are accepted are expected to attend
  PACT 2023 and present a poster of their work, as well as present it in
  a PACT session if selected from the poster session as a finalist.

### Eligibility

- Undergraduate students may submit team projects.
  However, only the first author will be eligible for the registration
  discount and to win prizes.
- Graduate students are required to submit alone.
  If a graduate student is submitting work that is part of a group
  research project, they may only present their portion of the research.
- If the research results have already appeared in a publication, prior
  to the SRC submission date, then they are not permitted to be submitted
  to an SRC for consideration.
  Furthermore, the same work may not be presented at an SRC and in
  another session at PACT 2023.
- The abstract and the poster must be authored by the participant.
- The participant can be from anywhere in the world, but must:
	- Be an ACM student member (you can join prior to entering;
	  [basic student membership is US $19 per year or less](https://www.acm.org/membership/)),
	- Maintain an undergraduate or graduate student status as of the
	  submission deadline.
- SRC allows parallel submissions of full papers in other conferences,
  as long as they abide by self-plagiarism rules (i.e., at least 30% of
  both the SRC abstract and the other publication is unique).
  That is, any other submission needs to be a minimum of 30% different
  than this SRC submission.
- The content of your SRC submission can be included in a future
  submission to other conferences or journals (as their rules permit).
