                The International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques (PACT) is a unique 
                technical conference sitting at the intersection of hardware and software, with a special emphasis on 
                parallelism. The PACT conference series brings together researchers from computer architectures, 
                compilers, execution environments, programming languages, and applications, to present and discuss their latest research results.<br>
                PACT 2024 will be held as an in-person event in Long Beach, California, USA. At least one of the authors 
                of accepted papers will be required to attend the conference, and we encourage all the authors to participate.

                <h1>Student Research Competition</h1>
                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>The Student Research Competition (SRC) at PACT 2024 provides a unique opportunity for students to present their research and receive feedback from experienced researchers in the community. This competition allows students to network, improve their presentation skills, and showcase their work to an audience of peers and experts. Both undergraduate and graduate students are encouraged to participate.</p>
            
                <h2>Eligibility Criteria</h2>
                <p>Participants must be current students (graduate or undergraduate) at the time of submission. An active ACM student membership is required. The competition is divided into two categories:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Undergraduate:</strong> Currently pursuing a bachelor's degree.</li>
                    <li><strong>Graduate:</strong> Currently pursuing a master's or PhD degree.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
                <p>Submissions should include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Problem and Motivation:</strong> Clearly define the problem and explain the need for a solution.</li>
                    <li><strong>Background and Related Work:</strong> Provide context and relevant references, highlighting how your work differs from existing research.</li>
                    <li><strong>Approach and Uniqueness:</strong> Describe your novel approach to addressing the problem.</li>
                    <li><strong>Results and Contributions:</strong> Present your findings and explain their significance to programming languages and computer science.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Submissions must be original and unpublished work. Submissions must be original research that is not already published at PACT or another conference or journal. One of the goals of the SRC is to give students feedback on ongoing, unpublished work. Furthermore, the abstract must be authored solely by the student. If the work is collaborative with others and/or part of a larger group project, the abstract should make clear what the student’s role was and should focus on that portion of the work.</p>
            
                <h2>Participation</h2>
                <p>The SRC consists of three rounds:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Paper Round:</strong> Submissions are reviewed by a committee.</li>
                    <li><strong>Poster Round:</strong> Accepted students present their posters to judges and attendees.</li>
                    <li><strong>Presentation Round:</strong> Selected students from the poster round give a final talk to judges.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Awards</h2>
                <p>Three winners from each category (undergraduate and graduate) will receive cash prizes ($500, $300, $200) and an award medal. The top students are invited to participate in the ACM Grand Finale.</p>
                
                <h2>Submissions</h2>
                <p>Submit your work using the specified format:</p>

                    <li>Limit to 2 pages, excluding references.</li>
                    <li>Ensure anonymity in the PDF (double-blind submission).</li>
